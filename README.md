# gothic-stash
![](https://github.com/Made-by-HRY/Gothic-Stash/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)  
This is a stash for a variety of different files for the Gothic game series.

This repository could become a MkDocs page someday, therefore the files are contained in a `docs/assets/sources/<Title>/*` path structure.
